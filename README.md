# css-grid
## Version 0.2.1

css-grid was made as a simple solution for creating a flexable website div grid system.  The _grid.scss contains a single map varible that can control the values of a mobile optimized site in one place.  Things like font-sizes or max-screen widths can be easily changed from this file in the variables section.
